Extremely Secure Apache HTTP Server configuration files

1. There is not a single place on the web you can find end-to-end Apache HTTP Server configuration. It's very frustrating. 
2. This repo will be finished by January 1st, 2019.
3. First configs will be for Ubuntu 18.04. A small bash script will be included for any installs of extra modules.
4. Later configs will be added for CentOS7/RHEL


NOTE:
If you are downloading Apache from the Debian 9 repo, or even the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS repo...you are going to be pretty behind (2.4.25 and 2.4.29 respectively). The latest version of Apache is 2.4.39 and a few of these directives will only work in 2.4.36.

Ubuntu 18.10 gives you 2.4.34, which is close enough.

Ideally you should compile from source, but I know that sucks...
