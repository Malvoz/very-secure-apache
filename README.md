Extremely Secure Apache HTTP Server configuration files

1. There is not a single place on the web you can find end-to-end Apache HTTP Server configuration. It's very frustrating. 
2. This repo will be finished by January 1st, 2019.
3. First configs will be for Ubuntu 18.04. A small bash script will be included for any installs of extra modules.
4. Later configs will be added for CentOS7/RHEL
